Often, you'll want to connect to Optimizely using AJAX, as we did when creating our WordPress plug-in.

In this sample, we'll show how you can send AJAX calls using jQuery. We'll define a `OptimizelyAPI` class that handles all the authentication and encoding for API requests.

You can see this connection in action in our WordPress sample below. To download it for use in your own projects, click the button below.
