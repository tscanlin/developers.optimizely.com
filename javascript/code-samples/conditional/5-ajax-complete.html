To activate an experiment after an AJAX call returns, leverage jQuery's `ajaxComplete` function to listen to completed AJAX requests. If the response contains or corresponds to the element that should be changed, activate the experiment.

Note: Optimizely's default (trimmed) version of jQuery does not contain the `ajaxComplete` function. To use this function, you can include the full version of jQuery in your Optimizely snippet (Project Settings -> Project Code Settings) or reference your own version of jQuery which loads above the Optimizely snippet via `window.$`.

Additionally, `$.ajaxComplete` can be disabled on your site if the AJAX setup is called with `global` option set to `false`, preventing this event from firing. See [jQuery's documentation](http://api.jquery.com/ajaxcomplete/) for more information.
