You can use the [Optimizely REST API](/rest/reference/index.html#lists) to upload
[user lists](https://help.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/206197347-User-List-Targeting-Create-audiences-based-on-lists-of-data)
to Optimizely, which you can use to target experiments and segment results.

To illustrate this functionality, we've built a sample script that queries for records in a Salesforce account and
uploads a user list to Optimizely based on that data, allowing you to, for instance, target an
experiment to customers who are in a particular industry according to your Salesforce data.
