# Experiment results

Developers can programmatically access experiment results through our REST API. The /stats and /results endpoints will return experiment data; however, the /stats endpoint should be used for experiments started after Jan 21st 2015. These endpoints enable teams to perform custom data analysis and the ability to create internal dashboards and workflows.
