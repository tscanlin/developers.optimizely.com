Create a schedule for an experiment. You must specify either a `start_time` or `stop_time`, or both. All times are in UTC and must be specified in the format `2015-01-01T08:00:00Z`. The created schedule will always be marked `ACTIVE`, and any previously created schedules will be marked as `INACTIVE`.
