Alias customer IDs to the specified Optimizely User ID.  The `dcp_service_id`, `optimizely_datasource_id`, and `optimizely_user_id` are required in the URL.

In the example, the customer IDs corresponding to datasources *8905* and *1232* are now aliased to the Optimizely User
ID *oeu1234.5678*. The Optimizely datasource ID is *678* and the DCP Service ID is *567*.

<div class="attention attention--warning push--bottom">
The `datasourceId` for this call should be the ID of the Optimizely datasource. You can find this ID using [list
datasources](/rest/reference#list-dcpservice-datasources) and finding the datasource with `is_optimizely=true`.
In this example, it is *678*.  The `customerId` for this call should be the Optimizely User ID. In this example, it is
*oeu1234.5678*.
</div>

You do not need to use this API in order for aliases to be created.  If you configure your
[datasources](https://help.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/216307487#add) with appropriate customer ID locators,
Optimizely will automatically alias your customer IDs to Optimizely User IDs (as customers visit your website).
