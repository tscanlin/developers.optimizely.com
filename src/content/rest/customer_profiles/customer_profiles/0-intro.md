Customer Profiles are a collection of customer user's attributes across Datasources.

The following APIs are designed to create, update and read customer's attributes data for a single datasource at a time.

To use these APIs make sure you have read the sections on [DCPServices](/rest/customer_profiles#customer_profile_service), [Datasources](/rest/customer_profiles#dcp_datasources
<img src="/assets/img/dcp/customer_profiles.png">), and [Attributes](/rest/customer_profiles#dcp_attributes)


Using [/consolidated_customer_profile_view](/rest/customer_profiles#consolidated-profile), you can retrieve the full Customer's Profile across Datasources.
