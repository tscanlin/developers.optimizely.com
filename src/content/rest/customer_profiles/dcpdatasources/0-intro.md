A Datasource stores a collection of customer attributes within the same ID space. You can use these attributes to create an audiences.

Multiple Datasources belong to a single DCPService. Using Aliases, you can associate customer attributes across Datasources to create a unified Customer Profile.

Upon providing a key field Locator (the location of this Datasources ID in the browser), Optimizely will make Alias links between customer attributes for this Datasource and the Optimizely Datasource.
