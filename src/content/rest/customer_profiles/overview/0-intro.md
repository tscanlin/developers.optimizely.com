Dynamic Customer Profiles (DCP) are a collection of your customers' attributes, including demographic data, behavioral
characteristics, or any other information particular to your industry and customers. DCP provides a consolidated,
dynamic view of your customers, enabling you to refine this view as you obtain more information, and to take action
based on this view.

A single customer profile contains attributes collected by Optimizely and attributes collected by you, or by services
that you use, and provided to Optimizely to create a single view of the customer. These attributes are organized and
stored by [datasource](/rest/customer_profiles#dcp_datasources) and linked across datasources using identity
[aliases](/rest/customer_profiles#alias).

Customer profiles can be used to create audiences for targeting, and exported for use in other integrations, or
analysis.

The APIs below can be used to create, update, and delete customer profiles.

For a quick introduction to the REST API, refer to the [Getting started](/rest/getting-started) guide and check out our
[FAQs](/rest/faqs).
