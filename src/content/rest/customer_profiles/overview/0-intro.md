Customer Profiles are a collection of a visitor attributes, such as demographic data, behavioral characteristics, or any other information particular to a visitor.  A single customer profile joins attributes collected by Optimizely with uploaded 1st and 3rd party attributes to create a single view of the customer. Attributes across [Data sources](/rest/customer_profiles#datasources) are reconciled using identity [Aliases](/rest/customer_profiles#alias).  Customer Profiles can then be leveraged for creating audiences for both targeting and segmentation.

The REST APIs below describe the steps needed to create, update and delete individual Customer Profiles alongside all related objects.

If you'd like a quick introduction to the REST API, refer to the [Getting started](/rest/guide) guide and check out our [FAQs](/rest/faqs).

Note: Customer Profiles are currently in Beta And are only available for whitelisted accounts. If you would like early access to these APIs please contact us at [targeting@optimizely.com](mailto:targeting@optimizely.com)! We are eager to hear your feedback!
