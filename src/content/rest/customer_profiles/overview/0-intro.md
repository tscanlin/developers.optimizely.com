Customer Profiles are a collection of customer (your users) attributes. Attributes can include data such as demographic data, behavioral characteristics, or any other information particular to a customer.

A single Customer Profile contains attributes collected by Optimizely alongside uploaded attributes to create a single view of the customer. Attributes for a single profile are stored by [Datasource](/rest/customer_profiles#dcp_datasources) and linked using identity [Aliases](/rest/customer_profiles#alias).  Customer Profiles can then be leveraged to create audiences for both targeting and segmentation.

The APIs below describe the steps needed to create, update, and delete individual Customer Profiles alongside all related objects.

If you'd like a quick introduction to the REST API, refer to the [Getting started](/rest/guide) guide and check out our [FAQs](/rest/faqs).

Note: Customer Profiles are currently in Beta and are only available for whitelisted accounts. This means the APIs are subject to change pending feedback from early customers. If you would like early access to these APIs please contact us at [customer-profiles@googlegroups.com](mailto:customer-profiles@googlegroups.com)! We are eager to hear your feedback!
