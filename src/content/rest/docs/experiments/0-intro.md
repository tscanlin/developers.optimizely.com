An A/B experiment is a set of rules for matching visitors to content and recording their conversions. Experiments are the hub that connect several other models:

- **Goals** measure conversions and determine a winner.
- **Audiences** determine which visitors will see an experiment.
- **Variations** define the code that should be applied on a page to change the experience for a visitor, and the percentage of visitors who should see that code.

A multivariate experiment also has **Sections**. A section is a collection of variations that all manipulate the same feature of the page.

A multipage experiment adds **Pages**, which manipulate different URLs on your site.
