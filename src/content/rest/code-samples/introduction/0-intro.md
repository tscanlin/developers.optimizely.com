In order to help you get up and running quickly, we have provided a number of code samples that you can use.
Be sure to modify the code appropriately before running in production!


* *Experiment results:* Utilize these code samples to better understand Optimizely's [/results endpoint](/samples/#results). This endpoint provides high-level insights from Optimizely's Stats Engine.

* *Audiences:* If you have data about the visitors to a site, you can use our platform to group those visitors into [Optimizely Audiences](/samples/#audiences). This makes it easy to target content to different audiences and segment experiment results.
