# Optimizely REST API

*The REST API allows you to manage Optimizely projects using code. Using the REST API, you can create, start, stop, and archive experiments programmatically inside your own application.*

The REST API includes full read/write access to customer data stored in Optimizely, including [projects](/rest/docs#projects), [experiments](/rest/docs#experiments), [variations](/rest/docs#variations), [goals](/rest/docs#goals), [audiences](/rest/docs#audiences), [dimensions](/rest/docs#dimensions), and more.

At Optimizely, we've built our web application around a REST API as we want to expose our core functionality to developers. Applications built on the REST API can get full access to Optimizely's data and services without requiring users to ever log into the Optimizely application. For example, many of our [technology partners](http://optimizely.com/partners/technology) have built integrations using the REST API that transfer data to and from Optimizely.

To see a full list endpoints supported in the REST API, refer to our [API reference](/rest/reference). If you're using the REST API for the first time, go to [Getting started](/rest/guide) which walks through how to get an API key and make your first API call.

If you have any questions about using the REST API, please reach out to [developers@optimizely.com](mailto:developers@optimizely.com). Our developer support team is happy to help support you building your application.
