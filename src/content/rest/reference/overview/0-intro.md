This page is a full reference for the REST API, including a list of all available endpoints. It also includes basic instructions on how to form requests and consume responses. Use the navigation on the left to find the documentation most relevant to you.

If instead you'd like a quick introduction to the REST API, refer to the [Guide](/rest/guide). You can also look at [Examples](/rest/examples) to see some common use cases of the REST API.

If you have any questions, please contact [developers@optimizely.com](mailto:developers@optimizely.com) for help.
