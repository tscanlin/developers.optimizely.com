To access the Optimizely API via Python, you can use our [Python Client Library](https://github.com/optimizely/optimizely-client-python).

Some of our friends have also built libraries for the Optimizely API. Please note that these libraries are not supported or endorsed by Optimizely.

* [Optimizely Ruby Gem](https://github.com/MartijnSch/optimizely-gem)
* [Optimizely PHP Library](https://github.com/FunnelEnvy/optimizely-php)
* [Optimizely Node Library](https://github.com/funnelenvy/optimizely-node)
* [Optimizely Command Line Interface](https://github.com/funnelenvy/optimizely-cli)
