This API is still relatively new, and we expect to add new resources and properties frequently. You should treat the data shown below as a subset of what might return in an API response.

For major changes to existing behavior, including removing functionality, we'll introduce a new version of the API and provide at least 3 months notice before deprecating an earlier version.
