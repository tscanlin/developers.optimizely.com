*For authorization code grants only.*

After you obtain an authorization code, you can exchange this authorization code for an access token by issuing an HTTP POST request to Optimizelyâ€™s authorization server.

The code at right shows an example request and a successful response. The response will include an access token (with a lifetime of 2 hours) as well as a *refresh token* that can be used to request more access tokens after the initial access token expires.
