Using the access token provided in the authorization response, your application can now access the REST API on behalf of the authorizing user. You can use the REST API as outlined in this documentation, except you should use a header in the format `Authorization: Bearer [token]` instead of `Token: [token]`, as shown in the example on the right.

Your application should check for 403 errors, in case the user has revoked application access or the token has expired. In such cases, to resume access you will need to prompt users to repeat the authorization flow.
