Sending DELETE on an experiment will **permanently delete the experiment and its results**.

In most cases, it's safer to archive the experiment by sending a `PUT` request with `{"status": "Archived"}`. This will remove the experiment from the Optimizely snippet and hide it in the project dashboard, but still leave it available under "Archived Experiments" for viewing and recovery later.
