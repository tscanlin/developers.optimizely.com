template: sidebyside
endpoint: experiments/1234/stats
endpoint_prefix: experiments/
endpoint_option: 1234
endpoint_suffix: /stats
type: GET
title: Get experiment results (stats engine)
anchor: get-stats
fields:
  variation_id: ID of the variation. If the experiment is a multivariate test, this field is a list of variation IDs delimited by the “_” character. (The field is a string rather than an integer to support this case.)
  variation_name: Name of the variation. If the experiment is a multivariate test, this field is a list of variation names delimited by commas (“,”).
  goal_id: ID of the goal.
  goal_name: Name of the goal.
  baseline_id: ID of the variation that is the baseline for this experiment.
  begin_time: Begin time for the result dataset in UTC.
  end_time: End time for the result dataset in UTC.
  visitors: Number of visitors that were shown this variation.
  conversions: Number of visitors that were shown this variation and converted to the specified goal.
  conversion_rate: Conversion rate, computed as **conversions**/**visitors**. Only present if this is not a revenue goal.
  status: Indicates whether a winner has been declared. Must take one of the values `winner`, `loser`, or `inconclusive`. For baseline variations, the value is always `baseline`.
  improvement: Relative improvement over the baseline, computed as the ratio of **conversion_rate** values minus 1. For revenue goals, this is computed as the ratio of **revenue&#95;per&#95;visitor** values minus 1.
  statistical_significance: The likelihood that the observed difference in conversion rates is not due to chance.
  difference: The absolute difference in conversion rates from baseline. For revenue goals, the difference in **revenue&#95;per&#95;visitor** from baseline.
  difference_confidence_interval_min: Lower value of the confidence interval for **difference**.
  difference_confidence_interval_max: Upper value of the confidence interval for **difference**.
  visitors_until_statistically_significant: Estimate for number of visitors required to reach statistical significance.
  is_revenue: Boolean indicating if this a revenue goal.
  revenue: Total revenue generated by this variation. Only present if this is a revenue goal.
  revenue_per_visitor: Average revenue per visitor, computed as **revenue**/**visitors**. Only present if this is a revenue goal.

The /stats endpoint is identical to the [/results](#get-results) endpoint, except that the **confidence** field (i.e. chance to beat baseline) has been replaced with result statistics provided by the <a target="_blank" href="https://help.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/200039895">Optimizely Stats Engine</a>.

<div class="lego-attention lego-attention--warning push--bottom">
<b>All experiments started on or after January 21, 2015 have statistics computed by Optimizely Stats Engine.</b> For consistency with the Optimizely results page, we recommend you use the /stats endpoint instead of the /results endpoint for all experiments started on or after January 21, 2015. You can continue to use the /results endpoint for all experiments, regardless of start date.</div>

The request requires an `experiment_id` and the response contains a list of JSON objects representing every combination of variations and goals that have been defined for that experiment. For example, if there are three variations and two goals defined for an experiment, the response will contain six JSON objects representing each `variation_id` and `goal_id` combination.

To filter results to visitors in a particular audience, add the optional `audience_id` parameter to the URL, e.g. `?audience_id=123`.

To filter results to visitors with a particular custom dimension value, add the optional `dimension_id` and `dimension_value` parameters, e.g. `?dimension_id=456&dimension_value=foo`.

The /stats endpoint may return a 503 error when it is overloaded. If you experience any issues please email us at [developers@optimizely.com](mailto:developers@optimizely.com).
