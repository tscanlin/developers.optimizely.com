The REST API lets you create and manage Optimizely projects and the experiments inside of them. The API is RESTful and encodes data in JSON.

Check out our [Technology Partners](http://optimizely.com/partners/technology) page to see examples of integrations built via the REST API.

The sections below explain how to authenticate with the API, form requests, and consume responses. Use the left sidebar to jump to a specific section, or check out the code samples section for walkthroughs of specific use cases.

If you have any questions, please contact [developers@optimizely.com](mailto:developers@optimizely.com) for help.
