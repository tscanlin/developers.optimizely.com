If you send a request and it succeeds, the response will include data in the JSON body and `200 OK` (GET), `201 CREATED` (POST), or `202 ACCEPTED` (PUT), or `204 NO CONTENT` (DELETE) as the HTTP response code.

If the request fails, we'll return one of the following error codes:

* **400: Bad Request** can happen if your request was not sent in valid JSON. It might help to specify a `Content-Type: application/json` header in your request. If you sent valid JSON, the error may also reference specific fields that were invalid.

* **401 Unauthorized** if your API token was missing or included in the body rather than the header.

* **403 Forbidden** if you provided an API token but it was invalid or revoked, or if you don't have read/write access to the entity you're trying to view/edit.

* **404 Not Found** if the `id` used in the request was inaccurate or you didn't have permission to view/edit it.

* **429 Too Many Requests** if you hit a rate limit for the API. If you receive this response, we recommend waiting at least 60 seconds before re-attempting the request.

* **503 Service Unavailable** if the API is overloaded or down for maintenance. If you receive this response, we recommend waiting at least 60 seconds before re-attempting the request.
