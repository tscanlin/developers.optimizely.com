When running Optimizely Personalization, your web page can also evaluate a behavioral query on demand using the
[query](/javascript/personalization/#query) API.

Notes:
- This type of behavioral query can evaluate to a complex value like a list or an [event object](#event-objects), in addition to a simple value like a number, boolean, or string.
- You analyze even more complex behavior by making multiple calls to the JavaScript API.
- You can also use the JavaScript API to debug behavioral queries that you're planning to use in your Custom Behavioral Attributes.
