# Optimizely JavaScript API

*The Optimizely JavaScript API provides a way for developers to modify the normal behavior of the Optimizely web snippet for specific use cases.*

Use the API to target activation based on specific page content or events, query the state of activation, bucketing, or conversion for use in custom analytics packages, and force visitors into specific variations, among other capabilities.

Refer to the [API reference](/javascript/reference) to see the full capabilities of the JavaScript API. If you're using the JavaScript API for the first time, go to [Getting started](/javascript/guide) which walks through how to access the Optimizely client object in a web browser and make some basic API calls.

If you have any questions about using the JavaScript API, please reach out to [developers@optimizely.com](mailto:developers@optimizely.com).
