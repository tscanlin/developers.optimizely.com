   var pollForElement = function(selector) {
     if ($(selector).length > 0) {
     // code to run once element is found on page
     }
     else {
       setTimeout(pollForElement, 50);
     }
   };

This function polls for an element on the page every 50ms that matches a specified selector.  This is useful when you want to modify an element that is not injected into the DOM until shortly after document ready.
