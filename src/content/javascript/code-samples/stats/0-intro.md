title: Experiment results (Stats Engine)

To illustrate how to [get experiment results](/rest/reference/index.html#get-stats) as provided by the
[Optimizely Stats Engine](https://help.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/200039895) via the REST API, we've built a
web application that polls for statistical significance and, when it finds that an experiment has reached significance
for the first time, uses the [Twilio API](https://www.twilio.com/api) to make a phone call to a predefined number,
informing the recipient that the experiment has reached significance.
