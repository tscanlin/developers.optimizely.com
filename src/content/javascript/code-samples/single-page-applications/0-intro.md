On traditional websites, when visitors click links, the links generally lead to a new URL and load an entirely new page. In [Single Page Applications](https://help.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/203326524-AngularJS-Backbone-js-React-and-other-Single-Page-Applications), the whole page doesn't reload; instead, certain content is changed, loaded, and swapped out in the current URL. Since Optimizely generally loads once per page load we've created these code samples to help accommodate the behavior of Single Page Applications.
