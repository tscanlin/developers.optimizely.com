In order to help you get up and running quickly, we have provided a number of code samples that you can use.
Be sure to modify the code appropriately before running in production!

#### Table of Contents

* *Event tracking:* To track events that are not provided out of the box by Optimizely (e.g. purchase data or offline conversions), check out our section on [Events](#advanced-goal-tracking) which explains all of our available tracking APIs.

* *Custom JS conditions:* If you expose first or third party data on the client, then you can use Optimizely's [custom JS conditions](#custom-js) to port data into different audiences.

* *Advanced use cases:* These [advanced use cases](#advanced-use-cases) will help you push the limits of what Optimizely is capable of doing within Project, Experiment, and Variation JavaScript.

* *Conditional activation:* Sometimes you'll want to trigger an Optimizely experiment dynamically, after some part of the page or screen has loaded. Read our [Conditional activation](#conditional) section for more information on how to control when Optimizely activates.

* *Helper functions:* Many times, it is necessary to use getter and setter methods within Optimizely to better interact with your website. This list of [helper functions](#helpers) are frequently used in Project, Experiment, and Variation JavaScript.

* *Mutually Exclusive:* In addition to normal experiments, you can [mutually exclusive](#mutually-exclusive) experiments.

* *Single page apps:* On traditional websites, when visitors click links, the links generally lead to a new URL and load an entirely new page. In Single Page Applications, the whole page doesn't reload; instead, certain content is changed, loaded, and swapped out in the current URL. Check out our [single page app](#single-page-apps) section to help accommodate the behavior of Single Page Applications.

* *Integrations:* Whether you're looking to create a custom integration with an analytics platform or if you're looking to do WordPress headline testing with Optimizely, these [integration code samples](#technology-integrations) will help you navigate these processes.

* *Variation code:* If you would like to write your own variation code instead of using the Optimizely visual editor, check out our [Variation code](#variation-code) section that explains how to format Optimizely variations with example code.
