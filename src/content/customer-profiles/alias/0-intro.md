Aliases are used to link each customer ID in your [datasources](/rest/reference#dcp_datasources) to an
Optimizely User ID.  The Optimizely User ID is either a
[UUID](/javascript/reference/index.html#universal-user-id-beta-a-name-uuid-a-) (stored in the `optimizelyPPID` cookie),
or a random ID generated by Optimizely (stored in the `optimizelyEndUserId` cookie).

As shown in the figure, an alias indicates that the *same customer* is identified by `ANON_ID_1` in "My Datasource" and
by `OEU_2` in the "Optimizely Datasource".  This allows Optimizely to present a
[consolidated customer profile](/customer-profiles/index.html#consolidated-profile)
for that customer and allows you to target customers based on all your datasources' attributes.
