# User whitelisting

Whitelisting provides the ability to force users into specific variations. This is specifically useful when running QA, reviewing your experiments and writing unit tests. 

To whitelist, select an experiment and edit the Whitelist on the right-hand side of the page. Here you can add user IDs and their variation. 

**Please note:** whitelisting supports a maximum of 10 users. Let us know if you need this increased.
