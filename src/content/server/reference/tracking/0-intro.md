You can easily track Optimizely goals from your code as shown in the example to the right. Note that you don't need to pass the assigned experiments or variations; Optimizely will drop any conversion events for users that are not part of an experiment that includes the goal.

<div class="attention attention--warning push--bottom">*Please note:* users must be activated into an experiment before calling `track()` to register a conversion event on results page.
