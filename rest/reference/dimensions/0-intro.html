Dimensions are attributes of visitors to your website or mobile app, such as demographic data, behavioral characteristics, or any other information particular to a visitor. Dimensions can be used to construct audiences and segment experiment results.

The REST API allows you to create, edit, or delete dimensions. If you want to track visitor data for a dimension you must use a client-side API (for websites, use the <a target="_blank" href="/javascript/#dimensions">JavaScript API</a>). To learn more about dimensions, see <a target="_blank" href="https://help.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/200040865-Dimensions-Capture-visitor-data-through-the-API">Dimensions: Capture visitor data through the API</a>.
