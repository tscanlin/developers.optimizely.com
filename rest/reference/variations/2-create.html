The `experiment_id` is required in the URL, and the `description` is required in the body. Most variations will also want to include `js_component`, but an Original can use the default value of an empty string.

Whenever possible, you should also include the correct `weight` and update the other variations so their weights sum to 10000.

Note that newly created experiments come with two variations created automatically, so you may need to PUT a variation rather than POSTing it.
