#### Editable fields

- `name`
- `description`
- `conditions` (see [Audience Conditions](/rest/conditions))
- `segmentation` (see [creating audiences](https://help.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/200039685-Audiences-Overview-Include-certain-visitors-in-your-experiment#creating))

Only Platinum customers can enable segmentation, and you can only enable segmentation on an audience if you have fewer than ten dimensions or other audiences enabled for segmentation. If you don't have sufficient permissions or already have 10 audiences/dimensions, the API will return an error.
