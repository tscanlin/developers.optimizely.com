The endpoints below should be added on after the version in the API URL.

#### GET
`GET` requests retrieve an entity or list of entities. They are always read-only.

To get a single entity, use its `id` in the URL. To get a list of all entities, leave it off.

If the operation succeeds, the response will include the data in the body and a `200 OK` response code.

#### POST
A `POST` requests creates an entity in Optimizely, relative to a certain parent (for example, an experiment within a project). The parent entity's `id` is provided in the URL, and the data for the entity being created is provided as JSON in the body.

If the operation succeeds, the response will include the created entity as JSON in the body, including a new `id` argument, and a `201 CREATED` response code.

#### PUT
A `PUT` request updates an entity. The `id` for the entity to update is provided in the URL, and the new data is provided in the body as JSON. Only the data that you're changing needs to be provided. Missing fields will keep their original values.

If the operation succeeds, the response will include the data in the body and a `202 ACCEPTED` response code.

#### DELETE
A `DELETE` request removes an entity. The `id` for the entity to delete is provided in the URL, and no data is sent in the body.

If the operation succeeds, the response will have a `204 NO CONTENT` response code.
