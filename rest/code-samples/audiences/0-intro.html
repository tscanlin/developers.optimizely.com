If you have data about the visitors to a site, you can use our platform to group those visitors into [Optimizely Audiences](https://help.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/200039685-Audiences-Choose-which-visitors-to-include). This makes it easy to target content to different audiences and segment experiment results.

In this example, we'll show how a data management platform could connect to Optimizely to create audiences and assign visitors to them on the fly. In this case, we'll use the REST API to create a "Truck Shoppers" audience, and then we'll use the JavaScript API to assign visitors to it whenever their cookie indicates they're in the market for a truck.
