*For authorization code grants only.*

After the authorization code exchange, you can exchange a refresh token for an access token by issuing an HTTPS POST request to Optimizelyâ€™s authorization server.

The code at right shows an example request and a successful response. In the event the user has revoked your access, you will receive an HTTP 403 response.
